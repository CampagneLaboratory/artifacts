Recent changes to the project will be described here:

- Add ability to register environment collection scripts. See request.registerEnvironmentCollection().
  These scripts will automatically be source before calling any plugin function. We will use this feature in GobyWeb
  to automate the sourcing of constants.sh and auto-options.sh before installing artifacts or getting attributes.
